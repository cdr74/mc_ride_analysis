# UI mockup — RideLogger "ride display" version (draft for discussion)

Status: **draft, nothing implemented.** Iterate on this document until the design is
nailed; only then code. Product decisions already made (2026-07-12):

- **No active calibration.** Guided calib flow (ADR 0003) is retired; calibration is solved
  automatically from ride phases. No calibration UI anywhere.
- **Phasing:** offline fusion validated first → in-app post-ride view → live display last.
  This mockup covers the end state so early phases build toward it.

## Design principles (from the wish list)

1. **Safety first.** Zero required interaction while moving. Everything glanceable, nothing readable-only.
2. **Minimal text during a ride.** Numbers and color, not words.
3. **Live display shows at most 2 dimensions**, chosen from: lean L/R · accel/brake · pitch fwd/back · speed.
4. **Rider chooses:** screen stays on with live display, or background capture (screen off), review after.
5. Post-ride analysis in-app (zoomable). Export to PC remains developer-only. Rides deletable anytime.

## Screen map

```
Home ──START──▶ Live display (screen-on mode)   ──stop──▶ Post-ride summary
  │        └──▶ Background capture (notification) ─┘            │
  ├── ride list ──tap──▶ Post-ride summary ──▶ traces (zoom)    │
  └── (long-press ride: delete / share*)              *dev builds only
```

No settings screen. Every choice lives where it's used.

- **✔ decided (Q8) — three-state startup, no status dot:**

  ```
  app start ──▶  Initializing …   ──all checks pass──▶  START button appears
                      │
                      └── anything inaccessible ──▶  error screen
  ```

  - **Initializing…** shown while sensors spin up and GPS acquires its first fix.
    No START button yet — it *appearing* is the ready signal.
  - **Error screen** when the app cannot access everything it needs (permission
    denied, location off, sensor rate capped by the mic privacy toggle, …):
    a comprehensive message listing each failed item and exactly how to fix it,
    with a button to the relevant system setting where possible. Re-checks
    automatically when the app returns to foreground.
  - Full Hz/fix/drop diagnostics block remains in dev builds only.
- If SCREEN = off: START minimizes the app, capture runs as today (foreground service +
  notification). Opening the app during capture shows the live display; leaving it again
  returns to background. Same code path, no separate mode.

## S2 · Live display — the 2-slot layout

Portrait, split horizontally. Slot content fills its half. While moving, touches on the
bar slots do nothing (no accidental slot-cycling); only STOP is active.

**Decided (2026-07-12): one unified bar grammar for all four dimensions.** Every slot is
a thick horizontal fill-bar on a recessed track, plus thin **session high-watermark
ticks** that persist for the ride. Two origin types:

- **Center-origin** (lean, accel/brake, pitch): bar sits at center when neutral, grows
  left/right. Watermark tick on *each* side.
- **Edge-origin** (speed): bar grows left→right from 0. One watermark.

```

┌──────────────────────────┐
│  ◄ 38                    │   numeral stays huge above the bar

│  ─────────────────┴───── │
│  0                    120│
└──────────────────────────┘
```

Per-dimension scales (constants, tune from ride data):

| dimension | origin | range | watermarks |
|---|---|---|---|
| lean | center | ±45° | left + right |
| accel / brake | center | ±10 m/s² (brake left, accel right) | both |
| pitch | center | ±20° (dive fwd, wheelie back) | both |
| speed | edge | 0–120 km/h | one |

Spec notes:

- Bar fill updates smoothed (~10 Hz visual, low-pass so it doesn't flicker with
  vibration); **watermark ticks move instantly** and never retreat during the ride.
- Watermarks reset at ride start. *(Option: additionally show the all-time personal max
  as an even fainter tick — say if wanted.)*
- Numeral above each bar is kept for the deliberate glance; the bar + watermark is the
  peripheral channel. *(Q1a: keep numerals, or bars only?)*
- **Lean below 18 km/h is not shown** (bar empty, numeral "—"): the bar-mounted phone
  moves with the steering assembly, and bar turn corrupts lean at low speed
  (DESIGN.md §11). Same cutoff post-ride: the lean trace has gaps below 18 km/h.
- **Calibration availability at ride start:** lean/accel/pitch bars need R_phone→bike.
  The app persists the last solved calibration and reuses it from the first second
  (valid — remount repeatability measured at ~1.25°), then re-solves opportunistically
  during the ride and swaps in the fresh solution. Very first ride on a device: those
  slots show "calibrating…" (blank bar) until the first solve lands, a few minutes in.
  Speed needs no calibration and always works.
- *(Q1b: should the bar change color as it approaches the watermark / a personal max —
  neutral → amber → red — or stay one high-contrast color?)*

### Stopping a ride

**✔ decided (Q2):** plain STOP button, always visible — no safety concern, stopping
happens when parked.

## S3 · Post-ride — summary of all dimensions, then per-dimension detail

**✔ decided (Q3, Q5, Q6):** a ride is a **data series over time** — no map, no geo
display. Post-ride opens with a summary of *all* dimensions; tapping one opens its
full-screen trace. Fancier analytics come later.

### S3a · Summary

Opens automatically after STOP (screen-on mode) or from the ride list. Each dimension
row reuses the live-display bar grammar (fill = session max reach, ticks = extremes).

- Fusion (lean/pitch) runs once when the ride closes — progress spinner on first open
  ("computing…"), cached afterwards.
- Units: **m/s²** for accel/brake everywhere (✔ Q4) — same raw unit as the log.

## Decision log & remaining questions

| # | Topic | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| Q1 | Live display treatment | ✔ unified bars + session watermarks · *assumed:* numerals kept above bars, subtle color shift near watermark — say if wrong |
| Q2 | Stop mechanism | ✔ plain always-visible STOP button |
| Q3 | Post-ride structure | ✔ all-dimension summary → tap a dimension → full-screen trace over time |
| Q4 | Accel unit | ✔ m/s² |
| Q5 | Map / geo display | ✔ none — a ride is a time series |
| Q6 | Analytics scope | ✔ v1 as mocked; fancy analytics later |
| Q7 | Marker button | ✔ **removed altogether** — no marker button, no marker concept in the next version (ground-truth labeling for algorithm work, if ever needed, happens post-ride, not with a button while riding) |
| Q8 | Home ready-status | ✔ "Initializing…" until ready, then START appears; comprehensive error screen if permissions/functionality missing; diagnostics in dev builds only |
